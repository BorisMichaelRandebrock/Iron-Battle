### How to play:
Initially the Game is going to ask you for the name of your first player. <br />
After entering the name of your choosing you will be prompted to choose a character which you can do by answering either "sword" or "warrior" to create a Warrior character, or "staff" or "wizard" to choose a Wizard. <br />
Obviously, for your opponent you will have to pass through the same process again (name and weappon or character...); <br/>
Then you willbe prompted to answer yes to start playing:<br/>
Lean back and enjoy:
